Project Brief

Create a two player browser based tic tac toe variation in JQuery which incorporates a secondary music creation mini-game.

Primary Game: Tic Tac Toe
Secondary Game: Music Creation

Implementation
  
  Primary Game

  The game was created  with a view to minimising repitition and confining the primary game to a single event listener; this    proved more difficult then I had anticipated as the function expanded and I began to appriciate the full scope of the project. I found that by creating repedative functions to achieve a desired outcome I was better able to appriciate and understand the use of simple loops to compact code.  I appllied this new appriciation to the design of my algorithm and was able to place the entire tic tac toe game on a singe event; this was combined with a broadened knowledge of DOM manipulation via style sheets and event bubbling to create a relativly simple, condensed function... until I hit win conditions... then I spend hours glaring at the screen and reading ALL THE DOCS to eventually use RegEx and an alternating 'active player' variable to compare two strings and return an effective indicator ofr win/draw conditions.
  
  Thus far I have the backbone of the game styled and usable; it will be continually developed.
  
  Secondary Game
  
  still in deveopment
